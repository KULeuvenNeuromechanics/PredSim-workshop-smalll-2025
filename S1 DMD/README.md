# DMD Case

Physics-based computer simulations that can predict the effect of underlying impairments (e.g., muscle weakness and muscle stiffness) and treatments (e.g., Achilles tendon lengthening) on gait in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have the potential to improve clinical decision-making. In this section, the user will personalize muscle parameters of a neuromusculoskeletal model based on the instrumented strength assessment and the clinical examination of a case with DMD and the user will simulate an intervention, i.e. Achilles tendon lengthening. 

The workflow you'll apply in this tutorial has been published in [Vandekerckhove et al.(2025)](https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12984-025-01631-x)

## Personalize muscle parameters based on instrumented assessment and clinical exam

In this section the user will use instrumented strength scores (step 1), and passive Range of Motion (ROM) scores and clinical stiffness scale scores (step 2) to personalize active muscle force and passive muscle stiffness, respectively. To save time, the user will only need to personalize the ankle muscles. We provide the hip and knee muscle personalizations.

To this end, you will edit the function [PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/code/update_settings.m](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/blob/main/code/update_settings.m). This function can later be used to run personalized simulations in PredSim.

### Step 1. Scaling muscle strength to model muscle weakness
The strength was assessed with fixed dynamometry. The user will scale the maximal active muscle force based on the instrumented strength scores to model subject-specific muscle weakness.

**Requirements:** web app [Anthropometric-related percentile curves for muscle strength of typically developing children](https://shiny.gbiomed.kuleuven.be/Z-score_calculator_muscle_strength/)

**Data:** Instrumented strength scores (mean joint torques), provided in [Clinical Exam/IWA_DMDcase.xlsx](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/blob/main/S1%20DMD/Clinical%20Exam/IWA_DMDcase.xlsx)

**Additional information:** The protocol of the instrumented strength assessment is provided in [Documentation](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/tree/main/Documentation) (Optional content you can explore if you want to learn more)

1. Open the web app ([Anthropometric-related percentile curves for muscle strength of typically developing children](https://shiny.gbiomed.kuleuven.be/Z-score_calculator_muscle_strength/)).
2. Open the excel with the mean joint torques from the instrumented weakness assessment provided in the Clinical Exam folder ([Clinical Exam/IWA_DMDcase.xlsx](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/blob/main/S1%20DMD/Clinical%20Exam/IWA_DMDcase.xlsx))
3. In the web app
 - Click on the tab `Ankle muscle strength` and enter body mass, height and mean ankle joint torques that are given in the excel file ([Clinical Exam/IWA_DMDcase.xlsx](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/blob/main/S1%20DMD/Clinical%20Exam/IWA_DMDcase.xlsx))

 - Click `Calculate z-score`
<img width="277.5" height="325" alt="Screenshot_app_2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306456cb-2707-423f-8b12-c69743abeb36" />

 - The web app will automatically plot the subject-specific torques on the TD percentile curves and compute z-scores as well as percentages relative to the median of the percentile curves (indicated via the red rectangle on the image below). You will use these percentages to scale the muscle strength of the model (in 4.)
<img width="4123" height="2071" alt="Screenshot_app_3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b742f52-eeff-413b-8f81-34579b370783" />

4. Open matlab and navigate to `PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/code` in matlab. Open the function `update_settings.m`. You will add the setting `S.settings.muscle_strength` to this function to scale the model’s muscle strengths using the percentage values calculated in the web app. Specifically, copy and paste the code below into `update_settings.m`. We have already provided scaling factors for the hip and knee muscles (e.g., the strength of glut_max is scaled to 22% of its original value (i.e., multiplied by 0.22)). You only need to update the scaling factors for `tib_ant`, `gastroc`, and `soleus` using the percentages you calculated in the web app (remember: a strength value of 100% means the scaling factor should be 1 (not 100)) :

	 	S.settings.muscle_strength = {... 
			{'iliopsoas_r', 'iliopsoas_l'}, 0.435, ...									% hip_flex
			{'glut_max_r', 'glut_max_l'}, 0.22, ...										% hip_ext
			{'rect_fem_r', 'vasti_r', 'rect_fem_l', 'vasti_l'}, 0.317, ...				% knee_ext
			{'bifemsh_r',  'bifemsh_l', 'hamstrings_r', 'hamstrings_l'}, 0.316, ...		% knee_flex
			{'tib_ant_r', 'tib_ant_l'}, 1, ...											% ankle_df
			{'gastroc_r', 'gastroc_l', 'soleus_r', 'soleus_l'}, 1,... 					% ankle_pf
			};
 
**Background:** The muscles in the model are represented as Hill-type muscle–tendon units. The muscle–tendon unit consists of an active contractile element in parallel with a passive element, which is in series with a tendon. The muscle force arises from both the active contractile component and the passive elastic element. The most common parametrization of this model assumes that maximal isometric force, and passive muscle and tendon stiffness are coupled. Therefore, they all scale with maximal isometric force. However, in DMD, active and passive muscle forces do not decrease simultaneously. The loss of contractile tissue is accompanied by its replacement with fat and fibrotic tissue, resulting in a decline in active muscle force while passive muscle stiffness increases. Therefore, we modeled muscle weakness by scaling only the active force component, rather than scaling maximal isometric force that also scales the passive elements.


### Step 2. Shifting the passive force-length curve to model passive muscle stiffness
Muscle stiffness was evaluated through passive ROM and clinical stiffness scale. The user will estimate the start of the passive force-length curves of the muscles based on the passive ROM and clinical stiffness scale to model subject-specific passive muscle stiffness. 

**Requirements:** OpenSim, Matlab.

**Data:** passive ROM and clinical stiffness scale values, provided in [Clinical Exam/Clinical_Exam_DMDCase.xlsx](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/blob/main/S1%20DMD/Clinical%20Exam/Clinical_Exam_DMDcase.xlsx), reference passive ROM values for typically developing children from Mudge et al., matched to the case’s age, are provided in subfolder [Clinical Exam/Ref_ROM_TD.xlsx](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/blob/main/S1%20DMD/Clinical%20Exam/Ref_ROM_TD.xlsx) 

**Code:** [Code/Personalize_passive_muscle_stiffness_based_on_CE.m](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/blob/main/S1%20DMD/Code/Personalize_passive_muscle_stiffness_based_on_CE.m)

**Additional information:** The protocol of the clinical examination is provided in [Documentation](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/tree/main/Documentation) (Optional content you can explore if you want to learn more)

1. In matlab navigate to `PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025\S1 DMD\Muscle stiffness code` and open the script `Personalize_passive_muscle_stiffness_based_on_CE.m`. This code guides users through the estimation process of passive muscle stiffness based on clinical assessments.
 - For future use: update lines 18-23 if the file paths or filenames change and update lines 27-62 if new clinical measurements are added and need to be linked to specific muscles

2. Run `Personalize_passive_muscle_stiffness_based_on_CE.m` by clicking the green 'Run' button. This script computes the start of the passive muscle force–length curve based on clinical examination data. It returns the normalized muscle length at which passive force begins, personalized using (1) ROM values and (2) the clinical stiffness scale. After running the script, matlab prints a table showing the shift calculated from ROM data, the shift from the clinical stiffness scale, and the average of the two.

3. Go back to `update_settings.m` in matlab (located in `PredSim-workshop-small-2025/code`) and add the setting `S.settings.muscle_pass_stiff_shift` to shift the passive force–length curves based on the clinical exam. Specifically, copy and paste the code below into `update_settings.m`. We have already provided the shifts for the hip and knee muscles. You only need to update the shifts for `gastroc` and `soleus` using the average shift printed after running `Personalize_passive_muscle_stiffness_based_on_CE.m` (outcome from 2.) :

	 	S.subject.muscle_pass_stiff_shift = {{'tib_'},0.9,...
     		{'gastroc_r','gastroc_l'},0.9,...
     		{'soleus_l', 'soleus_r'}, 0.9,...
     		{'bifemsh_r',  'bifemsh_l', 'hamstrings_r', 'hamstrings_l'},1,...
     		{'iliopsoas_r', 'iliopsoas_l', 'rect_fem_r', 'rect_fem_l'},1,...
     		}; 	 	 

**Background:** In DMD, contractile tissue is not only lost but also replaced by fat and fibrotic tissue, resulting in increased muscle stiffness and eventually leading to contractures. We modeled this by shifting the passive muscle force-length relationship to shorter fiber lengths through a reduction in the fiber length at which passive muscle force begins to develop. We use the ROM measurements and clinical stiffness scale to estimate this shift. For the ROM measurements, we estimate the difference in fiber length at which the muscle starts to develop passive force between TD and DMD from the difference in joint angle at the end of ROM. The joint angle at the end of ROM of TD children was based on age-related reference data reported by Mudge et al. To estimate the corresponding difference in fiber length, we multiply the difference in measured joint angle at end ROM between TD and DMD (in radians) with the moment arm of the muscles in the anatomical position. This difference in fiber length was normalized to optimal fiber length to compute the shift of the passive force-length relationship. 
For the clinical stiffness scale, the normalized fiber length at which passive force starts to develop was assumed 1 when the clinical stiffness score was 0 (no increased resistance), 0.83 when the score was 1 (minimal increased resistance), 0.67 when the score was 2 (increased resistance), and 0.5 when the score was 3 (highly pronounced resistance) corresponding to a shift of respectively 0, 0.17, 0.33, and 0.5. 
We shifted the passive force-length relationship by the mean of the shifts estimated based on the ROM and clinical stiffness score.

### Step 3. Running PredSim with estimated muscle parameters:

The user will run a predictive simulation in [PredSim](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim) using a 2D model with DMD-specific muscle impairments. 
Before this, you should have run a reference simulation (2D model, no impairments) by following the steps in the main [README](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/tree/main). Open [PredSim/main.m](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/blob/master/main.m) in matlab. Ensure that the file contains already the following settings: 
1. Line 20 - `[S] = initializeSettings('gait1018');`
2. Line 22 - `S.misc.gaitmotion_type = 'FullGaitCycle';`
3. Line 25 - `S.subject.name = 'gait1018';`

*If you have not run the reference simulation yet, you should either follow the instructions in the main [README](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/tree/main), or modify the three lines above in [PredSim/main.m](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/blob/master/main.m), then click the green 'Run' button.* 

To run a predictive simulation with the 2D model including DMD-specific impairments:
1. Line 21 - add `S = update_settings(S)` in [PredSim/main.m](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/blob/master/main.m). This will update the settings of the 2D model with the calculated muscle weakness and stiffness.
2. Click on the green 'Run' button

### Step 4. Visualizing and plotting the results

Once your simulations are done, the results are stored in `PredSimResults\gait1018` as `gait1018_vx`. Each time you run a simulation, it is saved with an incremental version number: v1, v2, v3, v4, … The most recently run simulation will always have the highest version number.

To visualize the mot file in OpenSim: 
1. Open OpenSim
2. Click on 'File > Open Model...' and navigate to the 2D model [PredSim/gait1018/gait1018.osim](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/blob/master/Subjects/gait1018/gait1018.osim) 
3. Click on 'File > Load Motion...' and navigate to the mot file of your simulation `PredSimResults/gait1018/gait1018_vx.mot`
4. Click on the 'Play forward' button to see the motion. You may also adapt the speed. 
   
To plot the kinematics of your simulations and compare them to the Experimental Data of the patient:
1. Open the script [PlotFigure/run_this_file_to_plot_figures_Case_DMD.m](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/blob/main/S1%20DMD/PlotFigure/run_this_file_to_plot_figures_Case_DMD.m) in matlab
2. Update **Lines 17 to 18** with the `.mat` files that contain your simulation results:
   - Line 17 - replace `gait1018_v1.mat` with the `.mat` file containing your **reference simulation** *(If the reference simulation was the first simulation you ran with this 2D model, the results are stored in v1)*
   - Line 18 - replace `gait1018_v2.mat` with the `.mat` file containing your **DMD simulation** *(If the DMD simulation was the second simulation you ran with this 2D model, the results are stored in v2)*
3. Click on the green 'Run' button

## Optional: simulate the effect of Achilles tendon lengthening

In this section, the user will simulate an Achilles tendon release in the DMD case to predict the effect of this intervention. 
This treatment was often performed in patients with DMD who walk on their toes (tiptoeing gait), but may cause loss of ambulation. 

### Step 5. Simulate an Achilles tendon lengthening surgery

1. Go to `update_settings.m` in matlab (located in `PredSim-workshop-small-2025/code`) and add the setting `S.subject.scale_MT_params` to scale the tendon slack length (lTs) in order to simulate a Achilles tendon lengthening. Specifically, copy the code below into `update_settings.m`. This line will scale the tendon slack length (lTs) of both muscles (left and right) by 1.3 :

	 	S.subject.scale_MT_params = {{'soleus_l', 'soleus_r', 'gastroc_r', 'gastroc_l'}, 'lTs', 1.3};	

Important: Do not change the other settings in `update_settings.m`. This way, you will simulate an Achilles tendon lengthening on a model that has DMD-specific muscle weakness and stiffness. 

### Step 6. Running PredSim with estimated muscle parameters:

The user will run a predictive simulation in [PredSim](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim) using a 2D model with DMD-specific muscle impairments and simulated Achilles tendon lengthening. 
1. Open [PredSim/main.m](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/blob/master/main.m) in matlab.
2. Click on the green 'Run' button

### Step 7. Visualizing and plotting the results

See **step 4** to visualize your simulation results in OpenSim 
   
To plot the kinematics of your simulations and compare them to the Experimental Data of the patient:
1. Open the script [PlotFigure/run_this_file_to_plot_figures_Case_DMD.m](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim-workshop-smalll-2025/blob/main/S1%20DMD/PlotFigure/run_this_file_to_plot_figures_Case_DMD.m) in matlab
2. Add **Line 19** with the `.mat` files that contain the results of your **simulated Achilles tendon lengthening**. Specifically, copy the code below to **Line 19**. *(If the DMD simulation was the second simulation you ran with this 2D model, the results are stored in v3, otherwise adapt vx)* :

	 	result_paths{3} = fullfile(results_folder,'gait1018','gait1018_v3.mat');
      
3. Modify **Line 22** to:

	 	legend_names = {'Reference simulation', 'DMD simulation', 'Simulated Achilles tendon lengthening'};
 
4. Click on the green 'Run' button
